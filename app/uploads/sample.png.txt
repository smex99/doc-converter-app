Dear Contact:
In my current job search | have approached the task on two fronts. First | check the job boards for
open sales positions. Second | research companies that I'd like to work for. Branson Products comes
out on top every time and it is my hope after reviewing my attached resume that you'll see the value
and experience | could bring to your organization.
In my current position | am responsible for regional sales for a national hair products company. |
cover a five county area maintaining current customers and developing relationships with new ones.
I've never shied away from cold calling because | understand it's a numbers game. The more cold
calls | make the greater the odds that I'll get new customers. My success rate is above average and
my sales have consistently been in the top 10 percent of regional sales. While | nurture new
relationships I'm cognizant of the value in customer loyalty as well and | provide my customer base
with the same attention. Since there is no direct competition between Branson Products and my
current employer the terms of my non-compete agreement do not apply. I'm a quick study and could
begin making cold calls almost immediately.
| look forward to discussing the possibility of joining your team and would consider my job search a
success for all. Thank you for your time and consideration.
Sincerely,
Your Name
